👋 Hi, 

My name is Rosário Dutra, I’m from Teresina - PI, and I currently live in Curitiba - PR. After spending several years immersed in the administrative/financial field and seeking new paths, I decided to transition to the tech field to pursue what I truly had an affinity for: programming and data analysis. I have a degree in Financial Management, and I am currently studying Data Management, while also taking courses for deeper immersion.

💢Expertise 

My main focus is data analysis, as I love collecting, manipulating, and interpreting information, transforming it into insights. At the same time, I am passionate about backend development; I enjoy solving complex problems and managing large volumes of data practically. I believe this combination helps me understand data better and contribute effectively to decision-making.
